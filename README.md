# React Portfolio

## Description
Portfolio of my accomplishments and skills, acts as a sort of resume. This was made with react and NodeJs and posted to Github Pages.

## Issues
This app is not *entirely* complete. The Portfolio page is supposed to be using cards, but it only has a list of linked elements. Furthermore i think the Page could look much better with rewritten CSS.
